"""
Workflow Definition for the Brand Guardian AI.

This module defines the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that orchestrates the
video compliance audit process. It connects the nodes (functional units)
using the StateGraph primitive from LangGraph.

Architecture:
    [START] -> [index_video_node] -> [audit_content_node] -> [END]

    # 1. Initialize the Graph with the State Schema
    # This ensures all nodes adhere to the 'VideoAuditState' data structure.
    workflow = StateGraph(VideoAuditState)

    # 2. Add Nodes (The Workers)
    # The first argument is the unique name of the node in the graph.
    # The second argument is the function to execute.

    # Define the entry point: When the graph starts, go to 'indexer'.
    workflow.set_entry_point("indexer")

    # Connect 'indexer' -> 'auditor'
    # Once the video is indexed (transcript extracted), move to compliance auditing.

    # Once the audit is complete, the workflow finishes.

    # 4. Compile the Graph
    # This validates the connections and creates the executable runnable.
